    <h3>SIMPLE CHOCOLATE CAKE</h3>
    <p>This recipe is a great easy recipe for to make simple choclate cakes.
    It uses very common ingredients found in most kitchen cupboards.
    You just need to gather all the ingredients, put them into a big bowl
    and mix them with a blender or mixer!
    It can also be used to make cupcakes too, if you adjust
    the cooking times as mentioned below.

    My favourite is Nutella and sliced banana.
